# CS428 Project 3
This is my project 3 for CS 428 Virtual and Augmented Reality. Simple classroom was provided and the job was to build on it. Player can interact with multiple of objects in VR, you can lift objects, move them and drop them down. All of them have physics and colliders alongside gravity. Player can also see few characters in the classroom all of which have different animation. User can also flip switches to turn on and off ligthing in the room. There is also sound coming from the phone that is made with 3D sound option to emulate real life sound fading if you get farther away from the source. All of the elements and classroom are in real life size to make it feel more realistic as if the player is actually inside the classroom.

To run the application you have to simply download and import the project into Unity3D. Once you do that go into File->Build Settings... and check your platform.
Once you do that you can build and run application by pressing Build And Run button. The application was written on Unity 2019.4.1f1 version and VRTK version 3.3.
